# Lane-Line-Detection
The project presents a Python program running on OpenCV library. The compiled program detects the lane markers on the road adaptable in both picture and video formats.
(Issue: Video rendering many not be well supported in Collab. Use of other notebooks or standard editors is preferred.)
